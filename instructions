Hello! 
Before you start, there are a few things you should keep in mind...

This is a two person game and you have to take turns to play your moves.
To play your move, there is a fixed way to instruct the computer to place your piece.

This is how the board would look at the start of each game:

   1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  
a  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  
b  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  
c  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  
d  .  .  .  O  @  .  .  .  
e  .  .  .  @  O  .  .  .  
f  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  
g  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  
h  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . 

The rows are marked alphabetically, from a to h, while the columns are marked numerically, from 1 to 8.
When you enter your move, you have to enter it as a single string, in which the row value is followed by the column value.

So for example, if you want to place a black piece in the 3rd row and in the 4th column, you will have to enter the move as:

    c4

After you enter c4, the board will look something like this:

   1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8
a  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
b  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
c  .  .  .  @  .  .  .  .
d  .  .  .  @  @  .  .  .
e  .  .  .  @  O  .  .  .
f  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
g  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
h  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .

Also if you want to skip a move, enter
   skip


There is one secret...
If both players enter their username as "switch up", the game would go to a frenzy mode, where there will be no guarantee who's turn is next.........

That would be it for you to know.
Have fun, and good luck destroying your opponent!
